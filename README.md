<h1>LEARN</h1>
<p>This is a simple routine project to keep my skills up-to-date as HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript keep evolving</p>
<p>Makes use of the various semantic and accessibility aspects of HTML5, the power of modern layout (flexbox, grid, flow-root etc) of CSS3 and some basic yet very powerful aspects of web APIs (DOM, Web Storage etc) in JavaScript.</p>
<p>Feel free to clone and see for yourself and you can always hit me on <a href="https://twitter.com/the1stenhancer">twitter</a> for questions or more.</p>
